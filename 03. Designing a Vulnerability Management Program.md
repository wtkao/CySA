# Designing a Vulnerability Management Program - 3

## **<u>PCI DSS</u>**

1.	Internal & External scans
2.	Must run at least quarterly. Or after any significant change to the network
3.	Internal scan must be run be conducted by qualified person
4.	High risk vulnerabilitys must be mitigated until a claen scan can be achived
5.	External scan must be conducted by a Approve Scanning Vendor (ASV)

- Segment systems that deal with cards so only that segment needs to be scanned. 

## **<u>FISMA</u>** - Federal Information Security Management Act  
A law updated in 2004 to codify the authority of the Department of Homeland Security with regard to implementation of information security policies. Uses a matrix of high, med, low X CIA

### FISMA mandates that public sector companies must adhere to NIST 800 - 53

## NIST 800 - 53

Below is the controls outloned in 800-53 for Vulnerability Scanning

**Potential impact**  
||Low|Med|High|
|-|---|---|----|
|Definition|**Limited** adverse effects|**Serious** adverse effects| **Severer or Catastrophic** adverse effects|  
|Baseline controls needed|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Enhanced controls needed|No|**1, 2, 5**|**1, 2, 4, 5**|

- All Federal systems must meet basic vulnerability scans regardless of impact categorisation 

**Baseline controls - (Low,Med,High Impact)** 

- Vulnerability scans are conducted and reported
- Scanning is automated and universal standards are used for .. 
  - enumeration, 
  - formatting checklists & test procedures 
  - measuring impact
- Vulnerability reports are reviewed
- Legitimate vulnerability’s are remediated
- Shares information to help eliminate similar vulnerability’s 

**Enhanced controls – may be required**  
1 Scanning tools can be updated for current vulnerability’s  
2 Scanner are updated prior to scanning  
4 Determine what information about assets is discoverable by adversaries and take corrective action  
5 Least privilege authentication on scans, but elevated privilege if needed.  

**Low Impact:**
- Baseline controls

**Med Impact:**  
- Baseline controls
- Enhanced controls - **1, 2, 5**

**High Impact:** 
- Baseline controls
- Enhanced controls - **1, 2, 4, 5**

--------------------------------

**Identifying Scan Targets**
- What classification of data are they
- What services do they offer
- Is it Dev, Prod, Qa or Test

**Determine Scan Frequency**
- Risk appetite 
- Regularity requirements (PCI DSS)
- Technical constraints (Time to scan environment)
- Licencing(Amount of scanners or parallel  scans)
- Business requirements (Performance)

**Tools**
- Nessus, QualysGuard, Rapid 7 Nexpose, OpenVAS, Nikito, Microsoft Security Analyser (MSA) 

**Credentialed scans:** More details can be gathered. Use least privilege  

**Agent based scans:** Local agent installed on asset. Performance & Maintainability issues  

**Vulnerability Scanning Lifecycle**
1. Detection
2. Remediation
3. Testing

## **Security Content Automation Protocol – SCAP**

| Abbreviation |Name|Use|
|--------------|----|---|
|**CCE**| Common Configuration Enumeration| System Config|
|**CPE**| Common Platform Enumeration | Product names/versions|
|**CVE**| Common Vulnerability Exposure | Software flaws|
|**CVSS**| Common Vulnerability Scoring System| Measurable / Descriptive severity of software flaws|
|**XCCDF**| Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format | Checklist & reporting|
|**OVAL**|Open Vulnerability & Asset Language | Low level testing for XCCDF checklist|

**Prioritizing Remediation**
- Criticality of the system and information at risk
- Difficulty of remediation
- Severity of the vulnerability (CVSS)
- Exposure of the vulnerability (exposed to the internet or internal resource) 

**Barriers**
- Service degradation – bandwith
- Customer commitments – MOUs – SLAs
- Governance & change management – Red tape
