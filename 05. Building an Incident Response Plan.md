# Building an Incident Response Plan 

1.	**Preparation**
2.	**Detection & Analysis**
3.	**Containment, Eradication & Recovery**
4.	**Post Incident Activates**

- **Event** - Any observable occurrence in a system
  - Can be good or bad - such as logon event, or incorrect password event
- **Adverse Event** - Any event that has a negative consequence
- **Incidents** - An imminent threat of violation, or a violation, of a security policy, acceptable use policy, or security standard practice
  - Coworker logging in under your account credentials, against policy
  - Coworker downloads and installs malware

## Preparation

CIRT Team Selected  

- Digital forensic workstations & software
- Backup devices
- Office supplies
- Laptops for data collection
- Space sever & Network equipment
- Blank removable media
- USB bootable media

## Detection & Analysis 

### NIST 800-61 - Incident Handling Guide
Four categories for security event indicators 
  1.	**Alerts** - IDS, IPS
  2.	**Logs** - From server/workstation, SIEM, Syslogs
  3.	**Publicly Available Information** - New vulns in the wild
  4.	**People** - report of unusual activity 

- Profile the network, mean activity, enables us to see unusual activity
- Understand normal end user behaviour
- Create a log policy, where & what’s to be logged
- Correlate logs to SIEM
- Sync clocks
- Maintain knowledgebase of systems
- pCap as soon as a Incident begins
- Filter information to reduce noise and clutter
- Seek assistance from external resources if needed.

## Containment, Eradication & Recovery
- Select a containment straggly
- Implement it to limit damage
- Gather additional evidence (legal/Knowledge)
- Identify the attacker or attacking system
- Eradicate the effects & recover to normal business operations

## Post Incident Activates 
- Lesson Learned
- Evidence retention 

### Building the Foundations for Incident Response

-	**Foundation of Orgs Incident Response Program**  
  -	Provides authority for response efforts
  -	Approved by CEO/CIO
  -	Should be fairly timeless and rarely need updating
-	**Contents**
  -	Statement of management commitment
  -	Purpose
  -	Objectives
  -	Scope
  -	Definitional Terms
  -	Roles, responsibilities, and authority
  -	Incident prioritization
  -	Performance Measure for CSIRT
  -	Reporting Requirements
  -	Contact Info - by position, not name
-	**Incident Response Procedures**
  -	Detailed Info
  -	Step-by-step guidelines
